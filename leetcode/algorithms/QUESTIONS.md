### Add Two Numbers (Linked List)

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit.
Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example:
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807

### Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

- Example 1:
  Input: "abcabcbb"
  Output: 3
  Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

- Example 2:
  Input: "bbbbb"
  Output: 1
  Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

- Example 3:
  Input: "pwwkew"
  Output: 3
  Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
  Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
